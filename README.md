# Niko Bellic Bot

He is a voice quip bot who recklessly patrols the Grand Theft Auto and gaming subreddits. Do *not* make him angry.

You can trigger him by commenting or making a post in /r/gaming or any GTA-related subreddit, as long as it contains
some combination of "Niko" and "GTA", or simply by typing "Niko Bellic", "nikobellicbot", or "hey cousin want to go bowling". 

He is based on Rockstar Games' character Niko Bellic. Find his work [here](https://reddit.com/u/nikobellicbot)
